                                The Trinity We affirm our belief in one God, infinite Spirit, creator of the universe in
                                six historical days, and sustainer of all things, who exists eternally in three persons,
                                God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are one in essence but
                                distinct in person and function.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                God the Father We affirm that the Father is the first person of the Trinity and the
                                source of all that God is and does. From Him the Son is eternally generated and from
                                Them the Spirit eternally proceeds. He is the designer of creation, the speaker of
                                revelation, the author of redemption, and the sovereign of history.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jesus Christ, the Son of God We affirm that the Lord Jesus Christ is the second person
                                of the Trinity. Eternally begotten from the Father, He is God. He was conceived by the
                                virgin Mary through a miracle of the Holy Spirit. He lives forever as perfect God and
                                perfect man: two distinct natures inseparably united in one person.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Holy Spirit We affirm that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity,
                                proceeding from the Father and Son and equal in deity. He is the giver of all life,
                                active in the creating and ordering of the universe: He is the agent of inspiration and
                                the new birth; He restrains sin and Satan; and He indwells and sanctifies all believers.
                                Creation We affirm that all things were created by God.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Angels were created as ministering agents, though some, under the leadership of Satan,
                                fell from their sinless state to become agents of evil. The universe was created in six
                                historical days and is continuously sustained by God; thus it both reflects His glory and
                                reveals His truth.
                                Human beings were directly created, not evolved, in the very image of God. As reasoning
                                moral agents, they are responsible under God for understanding and governing themselves
                                and the world.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Scriptures We affirm that the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, though written by men,
                                was supernaturally inspired by God so that all its words are the written true revelation of God,
                                it is therefore inerrant in the originals and authoritative in all matters.
                                It is to be understood by all through the illumination of the Holy Spirit,
                                its meaning determined by the historical, grammatical, and literary use of the author's
                                language, comparing Scripture with Scripture. Humanity We affirm that God created humans
                                as male and female in His image, and that life is to be respected and guarded from
                                conception until natural death. As image bearers, they are responsible under God for
                                understanding and governing themselves and the world. Adam, the first man, wilfully
                                disobeyed God having been tempted by Satan, bringing sin and death into the world.
                                As a result, all persons are sinners separated from God due to their sin nature, which
                                is evidenced in their wilfully acts of sin; and they are therefore subject to eternal
                                punishment, under the just condemnation of a holy God.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Work of Christ We affirm that Jesus Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice by the
                                appointment of the Father. He fulfilled the demands of God by His obedient life, died
                                on the cross in full substitution and payment for the sins of all, was buried, and on
                                the third day He arose physically and bodily from the dead. He ascended into heaven
                                where He now intercedes for all believers.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Salvation We affirm that each person can be saved only through the work of Jesus Christ,
                                through repentance of sin and by faith alone in Him as Savior. The believer is declared
                                righteous, born again by the Holy Spirit, turned from sin, and assured of heaven.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Church We affirm that there is one church, the body and bride of Christ, and that it
                                is expressed in local assemblies of born again believers under the discipline of the Word
                                of God and the lordship of Christ. Its mission is to glorify God by making disciples
                                who love God and love people. It administers the ordinances of believer's baptism and
                                the Lord's Supper. The church is led by pastors and deacons/elders.
                                It is self-governing and functions through the ministry of gifts given by the
                                Holy Spirit to each member.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Marriage and Family We affirm that marriage is designed and instituted by God to unite one natural-born man and one natural-born woman in a lifetime covenant with Him and each other.
                                It exists to foster holy, intimate companionship; to serve as an illustration of the relationship between Jesus and His church; and to have and raise children in the faith.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Return of Christ We affirm that the return of Christ for all believers in the rapture is imminent. It will be followed by seven years of great tribulation, and then the coming of Christ to establish His earthly kingdom for a thousand years. The unsaved will then be raised and judged according to their works and separated forever from God in hell along with Satan and his demons. The saved, having been raised, will live forever in heaven in fellowship with God and his holy angels.
