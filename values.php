                                Commitment to Scripture: Without a doubt, Antioch Community Fellowship and all of their branches are built upon the Word of God. Since its inception, we have never wavered nor compromised on the inspired, infallible, and inerrant Word of God. We are committed to accurately teaching and preaching Holy Scripture at every opportunity. Whether in a Sunday morning service or a Home Group, we place a high value on the Word of God. Are you hungry for God's Word? Do you desire to know God's will for your life? Then, get into God's Word today. Join with the Psalmist in saying: "Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." Psalm 119:105

                                Culture of Prayer: Our fellowship is committed to integrating prayer into every aspect of our ministry. Jeremiah 33:3 says, "Call to Me and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know." We humbly realise our dependence upon the Lord. We strive to make every fellowship a house of prayer. We want it to be part of our culture every minute of every day on our villages, town, cities in the Worship Centres and throughout our entire vicinities. May we never forget the words of our founding Trustee, Dr. Bishop Wilson Mamboleo: "Nothing of eternal significance is ever accomplished apart from prayer."

                                Lifestyle of Worship: Any time the word "worship" is mentioned in Christian circles, the first thing that comes to the minds of most believers is "music" - the praise and worship songs we sing on Sunday mornings. While it is true that we can find great joy in worshipping God through music, the very act of worship is not to be limited to a song or a series of songs on Sunday morning. True worship of God is to be reflected in our lifestyle - in every moment... in every decision... in every relationship. Matthew 22:37 says, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." "All" is not limited to Sundays - "all" is everything we have, every moment we are given and in every situation that God brings into our path. What a responsibility! We are asking God to create a desire within all of us to honour, glorify and praise God through our lives.

                                Connection to Community: We were never supposed to live the Christian life alone. We are to "bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." (Galatians 6:2) At ACF we value each member's commitment to loving and serving each other. Yes, we do this on Sunday morning, but we also strive to support each other during the week. One of the best ways to experience this type of community is to be connected to a Home Group. These small groups meet on Sunday mornings (Bible study) as well as during the week in homes of our members.
                                These groups allow you to develop authentic, deep relationships that encourage you, as you are an encouragement to others. Heart for Serving Built upon the principles in John 13, Acts 2, and Ephesians 2 and 4, we are to serve one another in the body of Christ. Jesus commanded us to love one another. One of the most practical ways we can truly love our brothers and sisters in Christ is to serve each other using the spiritual gifts that God has given to us. What is your spiritual gift? How are you using it in our local church to serve fellow church members? If you have not yet discovered your spiritual gift or are looking for areas where you can share your gift, Talk to your Pastor. Let's all commit to serving each other as Christ has commanded us to do.

                                Passion for Sharing: Passion for Sharing takes us outside the walls of our church. ACF - wants to compassionately serve our local communities, as well as, actively participate in missions around the nation and the world. We want to reach our town and the "uttermost parts of the earth". Jesus was moved with compassion as He ministered to the multitudes. Romans
                                10:14 reminds Us: "How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?* We are committed to following His example by intentionally developing relationships that 'earn' us the right to actively share the Gospel. ACF branches has a schedule to do what they have purposed.
